bootstrap-buttons
=================

**Easily customize the color scheme of Bootstrap's button set.** Simply open the SASS file (you don't need to know SASS -- just how to compile it), enter new values for the seven variables at the top of the file, and then included the compiled CSS *below* the Bootstrap style sheet.

## Instructions

* Download bootstrap-buttons.sass. Replace the HEX values at the top of bootstrap-buttons.sass with your project's own kickass colors (0to255.com is a good resource, if you need to find slightly lighter or darker tints to make your buttons all look good together)

* Compile bootstrap-buttons.sass to a CSS file that is included BELOW Bootstrap's style sheet. (If you don't want to download the SASS gem and generally be anywhere near the command line, I recommend CodeKit for compiling SASS.) 

* Pat yourself on the back. You've saved the web from another set of default Bootstrap buttons.
